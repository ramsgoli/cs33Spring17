In general, a function is not reentrant if it doesn't use any shared resources,
i.e. it doesn't use any shared variables, data, etc.
The RIO functions all accept a pointer to a buffer to write to as an argument.
If the user calls these RIO functions and passes in pointers to the same buffer,
the functions are not considered reentrant. One of the functions could be modifying
the buffer, but then be interrupted. When execution returns to this function, the buffer
could be modified by some other process operating on the same buffer. Thus, the functions 
cannot be considered reentrant.
